Additionally, the function signature is quite long, which may affect readability. Consider breaking it down or using a struct to encapsulate parameters. Overall, the function is functional but could benefit from improved clarity and maintainability |
| **File Location** | src/actor/archive.rs (Lines 150-162) |

## Function: `test_simple_process`

| **Aspect**        | **Details** |
|-------------------|------------|
| **Description**   | test_simple_process, This function sets up a testing environment for a graph-based system but has several TODOs indicating incomplete tests and assertions. The use of `await` suggests it is asynchronous, but the lack of error handling for the channel operations could lead to unhandled exceptions. The comments indicate areas needing attention, particularly confirming output values, which are crucial for test validity. The function's clarity could be improved by providing more context in the comments about the expected behavior and outcomes. Overall, while the structure is sound, the function is not fully operational as a test due to the TODOs and missing assertions, which could lead to confusion for future maintainers. Therefore, it has moderate concerns regarding clarity and completeness, but no critical issues. 1, run, src/actor/parse_function.rs} |
