## Function: `send_prompt_to_chatgpt`

| **Aspect**        | **Details** |
|-------------------|------------|
| **Severity**      | <span style="color:orange;">Medium Severity</span> |
| **Description**   | The function effectively sends a prompt to the ChatGPT API and handles the response. However, it lacks error handling for the JSON parsing, which could lead to panics if the expected structure is not met. Additionally, the hardcoded model name "gpt-4o-mini" may need to be parameterized for flexibility. The use of dotenv is good for managing environment variables, but it would be better to handle the case where the API key is not found more gracefully. Overall, while the function works, improving error handling and configurability would enhance maintainability and robustness. |

## Function: `internal_behavior`

| **Aspect**        | **Details** |
|-------------------|------------|
| **Severity**      | <span style="color:orange;">Medium Severity</span> |
| **Description**   | The function implements an asynchronous actor pattern effectively, but it has several maintainability concerns. The use of commented-out code and TODOs suggests incomplete implementation and could lead to confusion for future developers. The variable names are somewhat generic, which may hinder readability. Additionally, the error handling could be improved; currently, it only logs errors without providing a mechanism for recovery or user feedback. The function's purpose is clear, but the overall structure could benefit from better organization and clarity. Consider refactoring to reduce complexity and improve documentation. |

## Function: `test_simple_process`

| **Aspect**        | **Details** |
|-------------------|------------|
| **Severity**      | <span style="color:orange;">Medium Severity</span> |
| **Description**   | The function sets up a testing environment using a graph structure, but it has several TODO comments indicating incomplete implementation. The test function sends a default vector of CodeFunction, which may not be valid for the intended test. Additionally, the assertion for confirming output values is commented out, which undermines the function's purpose. The use of async and channels is appropriate, but the clarity of the test's intent could be improved with more descriptive comments and a complete test case. Overall, while the function is functional, it lacks clarity and completeness, which could hinder maintainability. |

## Function: `run`

| **Aspect**        | **Details** |
|-------------------|------------|
| **Severity**      | <span style="color:orange;">Medium Severity</span> |
| **Description**   | The function is generally functional but lacks clarity in its purpose and the use of the `_cli_args` variable, which is declared but not utilized. The inline comments provide some context but could be more descriptive regarding the overall flow and intent of the function. Additionally, the naming of the function and parameters could be improved for better readability and maintainability. Consider adding error handling for the asynchronous call to `internal_behavior`, as it currently assumes success without any checks. Overall, while the function works, enhancing its clarity and robustness would be beneficial. |
