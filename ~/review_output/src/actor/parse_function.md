## Function: `run`

| **Aspect**        | **Details** |
|-------------------|------------|
| **Severity**      | <span style="color:orange;">Medium Severity</span> |
| **Description**   | The function is generally functional but lacks clarity in its purpose and the use of the context and command variables could be better documented. The inline comments provide some context but could be expanded to explain the overall flow and intent of the function. Additionally, the naming of the variables could be more descriptive to enhance maintainability. The use of the `into_monitor!` macro is not clear without additional context, which may hinder understanding for new developers. Overall, while the function works, improving clarity and documentation would significantly enhance its maintainability. |
