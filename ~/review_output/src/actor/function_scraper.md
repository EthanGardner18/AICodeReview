## Function: `run`

| **Aspect**        | **Details** |
|-------------------|------------|
| **Severity**      | <span style="color:orange;">Medium Severity</span> |
| **Description**   | The function is generally functional but lacks clarity in its purpose and the use of inline comments could be improved for better maintainability. The variable names are somewhat ambiguous, particularly 'cmd', which does not clearly convey its role. Additionally, the function could benefit from error handling to manage potential issues with the asynchronous calls. Overall, while it performs its intended task, enhancing clarity and robustness would be beneficial. |

## Function: `extract_function_from_signal`

| **Aspect**        | **Details** |
|-------------------|------------|
| **Severity**      | <span style="color:orange;">Medium Severity</span> |
| **Description**   | This function effectively extracts a function from a signal, but it has some maintainability concerns. The regex pattern is hardcoded, which could be moved to a configuration or constant file for better flexibility. The error handling is thorough, but the logging could be more consistent in terms of verbosity. Additionally, the function could benefit from breaking down into smaller helper functions to improve readability and reduce complexity. Overall, while the function works as intended, its clarity and maintainability could be enhanced. |

## Function: `extract_function_details`

| **Aspect**        | **Details** |
|-------------------|------------|
| **Severity**      | <span style="color:orange;">Medium Severity</span> |
| **Description**   | The function effectively opens a file and extracts function details using regex, but it lacks clarity in error handling for the writing process and could benefit from more explicit documentation regarding its side effects. The regex pattern could also be improved for better performance and maintainability. Additionally, the use of `trace!` for debugging is good practice, but it should be noted that excessive logging can impact performance in production. Overall, while the function is functional, enhancing clarity and documentation would improve maintainability. |

## Function: `read_function_content`

| **Aspect**        | **Details** |
|-------------------|------------|
| **Severity**      | <span style="color:orange;">Medium Severity</span> |
| **Description**   | The function reads a specified range of lines from a file and handles errors well. However, the error message could be improved for clarity and consistency. The use of 1-indexing for line numbers may confuse users accustomed to 0-indexing. Additionally, the function could benefit from more explicit documentation regarding its parameters and return values to enhance maintainability. Overall, while the function is functional, these improvements would enhance its clarity and usability. |

## Function: `write_hashmap_to_file`

| **Aspect**        | **Details** |
|-------------------|------------|
| **Severity**      | <span style="color:green;">Low Severity</span> |
| **Description**   | The function effectively writes a HashMap to a file with proper error handling and clear output. The use of OpenOptions is appropriate for file operations. The inline comments could be improved for clarity, but overall, the function is straightforward and maintainable. It is safe to ship. |
