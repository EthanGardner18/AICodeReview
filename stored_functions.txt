Overall, the function is clear and maintainable, but these minor adjustments could enhance its utility, 1, read_function_content, src/actor/function_scraper.rs}
{read_function_content, This function reads a specified range of lines from a file and returns them as a single string. It handles file opening and reading efficiently, but there are potential issues with index out-of-bounds errors if start_line or end_line are outside the valid range of lines in the file. Adding checks for these indices would enhance robustness. Additionally, the function could benefit from clearer documentation regarding the expected line range and error handling. Overall, it is functional but could be improved for safety and clarity, 1, extract_function_from_signal, src/actor/function_scraper.rs}
{extract_function_from_signal, This function effectively extracts a function from a signal, utilizing regex for pattern matching and handling file reading. However, it lacks error handling for file operations beyond the initial open, which could lead to unhandled exceptions. The use of hardcoded "test.txt" may limit flexibility; consider passing the file path as a parameter. The regex pattern could also be made more robust to handle variations in whitespace or formatting. Additionally, the inline comments could be more descriptive to clarify intent, especially around the regex matching logic. Overall, while functional, improvements in error handling and parameterization would enhance maintainability, 1, extract_function_details, src/actor/function_scraper.rs}
{extract_function_details, This function effectively extracts function details from a file using regex and stores them in a HashMap. The error handling is appropriate, but the debug print statement may clutter the output in production. Consider using a logging framework instead. Additionally, the function could benefit from more descriptive comments explaining the regex pattern and its purpose. The writing of the HashMap to a file is handled well, but it would be better to return an error if this operation fails instead of just logging it.
