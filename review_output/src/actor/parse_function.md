## Function: `chatgpt_firstfunction`

| **Aspect**        | **Details** |

| **Severity**      | <span style="color:orange;">Medium Severity</span> |
| **Description**   | The function effectively sets up an API call to OpenAI's chat completions but has some maintainability concerns. The use of dotenv for environment variable management is good, but the error handling for the API key retrieval could be improved to avoid panics. The request body construction is clear, but the hardcoded model name and other parameters could be externalized for better configurability. Additionally, the function lacks detailed inline comments explaining the purpose of each section, which would enhance clarity for future maintainers. Overall, while the function works as intended, it could benefit from improved error handling and configurability. |
