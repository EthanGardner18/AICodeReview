## Function: `generate_markdown`

| **Aspect**        | **Details** |

| **Severity**      | <span style="color:orange;">Medium Severity</span> |
| **Description**   | The function generates a markdown string from an archived function's review message, but it has some maintainability concerns. The use of `trim_matches` could be replaced with a more robust parsing method to handle edge cases. The error handling for `get_file_modified_time` could be improved to avoid returning a string in case of an error, which may lead to inconsistencies in the output format. Additionally, the inline comments could be more descriptive to clarify the intent behind certain operations. Overall, while the function works as intended, enhancing clarity and robustness would improve maintainability. |
